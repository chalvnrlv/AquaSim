## Key Features (with Fish Naming):
### Predefined 3D Fish Models:
- Users choose from a selection of predefined 3D fish models (like goldfish, clownfish, shark, etc.).

### Color and Drawing Customization:
- Users can pick colors and draw directly onto the selected 3D fish models using a 2D canvas for real-time texture customization.

### Fish Naming:
- After customizing the fish, the user can give the fish a unique name.
- The name will appear above the fish in the aquarium when the user hovers over or clicks on it.

### Deploying the Fish into the Aquarium:
- Once the fish is customized and named, it is added to the 3D aquarium.
- The fish will swim around, and the name will be visible when the user interacts with the fish (hovering or clicking).

## Milestones

### Milestone 0: Brainstorming the project
- Discuss the project
- Discuss the key features
- Job Delegations
  
### Milestone 1: Core Aquarium and Fish Models
- Set up the aquarium scene with lighting, water effects, and basic fish models.
- Implement camera controls for user navigation (using OrbitControls).

### Milestone 2: Customization and Naming
- Create the UI for fish selection, color picking, and drawing on the fish.
- Set up fish name input and store the fish name.
- Implement real-time texture application for the fish based on user drawings.

### Milestone 3: Deployment and Interactivity
- Deploy customized fish with names into the main aquarium.
- Implement random swimming behavior for all deployed fish.
- Add fish interaction (showing name on hover or click using raycasting).

### Milestone 4: Final Polish and Deployment
- Add final touches to the UI, textures, and animations.
- Test and debug across different devices.
